# Image-Search
The idea is to extract the features of the query image then compare it with other images in the dataset as an index.csv file using MSE method.

To initialize a index.csv file, run command: python index.py -d 'dataset's path' -i index.csv

To search the image, run command: python interface.py.

In the UI, click 'Open image' to choose a query image, click 'Crop' to crop a specific sub-image, then click 'Summit' to generate the result images
